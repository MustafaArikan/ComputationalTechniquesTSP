  Presentation:
    - Introduction to the problem of TSP (Mohammed)
    - Berlin52 and ch130 data sets (Mohamed)
    - Simulated Annealing Approach (general idea) (Neil)
    - Exponential vs linear vs ... (Neil)
    - Results ( Runtime analysis and show the program, runtime for optimal solution, cooling to distance )
    - Comparison with different (cooling systems, and probability for acceptance)
    - Comparison for runtime
    - Visualization for (optimal versus our solution)
    - Summary, Conclusion
